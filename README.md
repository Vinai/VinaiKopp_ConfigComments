Description
-----------
This module adds the possibility to add comments to system config fields.  
Simply hover over the number displayed on the left of every field to see the popup.  
To add a comment, enter it in the input field and click "Add".
To edit a comment, click on the one you want to update. To save the changes simply click anywhere outside the field.  
To delete a comment, click the little x on the right beside each comment.

A little [screencast](http://quick.as/6r7asxmx) is available, but since I don't know how to embed quick.as casts right now, here is a screenshot, too:
